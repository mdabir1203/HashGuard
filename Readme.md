# Ultimate Guide to Secure Password Hashing and Verification with Rust and PBKDF2
## Introduction
Ensuring the security of user passwords is paramount importance in today's digital world. One of the most effective methods for securing passwords is through hashing, specifically using the PBKDF2 (Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2) algorithm. In this comprehensive guide, we'll dive into secure password hashing and verification using Rust and PBKDF2, making security easier for developers of all levels to understand and implement.

## What is Password Hashing and Why is it Important?
Password hashing is the process of transforming a plain text password into a secure, fixed-size string of characters. This transformation makes it nearly impossible to revert the hash back to the original password, ensuring the safety of user credentials even if the database is compromised.

## Key reasons for password hashing:

**Security:** Protects passwords from being easily deciphered if the data is breached.
**Salting:** Adds an additional layer of security by appending a random string to the password before hashing.
**Iteration Count:** Increases the complexity and time required to brute-force the hash.
